Choose 2 - Add email samples (communication patterns, authentication data)

For Analysis:
Choose 3 - View current statistics of your accumulated data

Choose 4 - Review existing samples you've collected

For Model Improvement:
Choose 5 - Retrain AI models with new accumulated data

⚠️ Use with Caution:
Choose 6 - Only if you need to completely clear your dataset

Choose 7 - To exit the program safely

💡 Suggested First Steps:
If you're just starting, I'd recommend:

Start with option 1 or 2 to begin accumulating data samples
